i'm forgetting if there are multiple commands for installing Django. I did the pip install Django but when I try to start a project, I need Django-admin as well?
Rafael GPL to Everyone (5:52 PM)
yes, pip3 install django is the only command we need, and that installs the django-admin cli for you
so after pip3 install django, you should have access to it

after makemigrations command we don't have to add the name of the app we're in?
